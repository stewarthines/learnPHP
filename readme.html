<p>I&#8217;ve decided I need to get a slight handle on PHP. It is not <em>the best</em> language in the world. But, WordPress is written in PHP and that is a very commonly requested thing to know. WordPress also happens to be the best free CMS I can get my grubby little hands on. So, knowing PHP would be very helpful. Also, it could be helpful to know how to use PHP to write websites for other people. </p>
